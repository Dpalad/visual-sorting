# visual-sorting
A program I created, that visualizes sorting algorithms. (some of them are two algorithms "merged" together)

Available sorting algorithms:
	Simple Swap Sort
	Selection Sort
	Bubble Sort
	Insertion Sort
	Quick Sort
	Merge Sort
	Heap Sort
	Intro Sort
	Shell Sort
	Cycle Sort
	Gravity Sort
	Cocktail Shaker Sort
	Comb Sort
	Gnome Sort
	Odd-Even Sort
	Bitonic Sort(only sorts powers of 2)
	Random Number Sort
	Radix Sort
	Slow Sort
	Quick Merge Sort
	Double Insertion Sort
	Counting Sort
	Selection Merge Sort
	Bubble Merge Sort
	Insertion Merge Sort
	Shell Merge Sort
